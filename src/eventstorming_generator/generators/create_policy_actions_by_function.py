        <rule id="2">**NO SAME-AGGREGATE POLICIES**: Policies must only connect events between DIFFERENT aggregates. Logic within the same aggregate must be handled internally.</rule>

## User Story
As a customer, I want to make a restaurant reservation and receive confirmation.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Reservation should be created with customer details and party size.
  - System should automatically assign an appropriate table.
  - Kitchen should be notified for preparation.
  - Customer should receive a confirmation.

## Key Domain Events
- `ReservationCreated`: A new reservation is created by the customer.
- `TableAssigned`: A table has been assigned to the reservation.
- `KitchenNotified`: The kitchen has been notified for preparation.
- `ReservationConfirmed`: The reservation is fully confirmed.

## DDL Snippet
```sql
CREATE TABLE reservations (
    reservation_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    party_size INT,
    status VARCHAR(50) -- 'PENDING', 'CONFIRMED'
);
```

## Context Relations
- **Name**: ReservationToKitchen
- **Type**: Pub/Sub
- **Interaction**: Reservation Service publishes `ReservationConfirmed` events. The Kitchen Service subscribes to trigger preparation.
- **Reason**: The kitchen needs to prepare for confirmed reservations.
