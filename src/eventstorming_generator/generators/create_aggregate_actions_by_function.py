## Role
This context is responsible for the entire lifecycle of a course, including its creation, management, and tracking. It handles course content, instructor assignments, pricing, and status changes (e.g., Draft, Published, Archived). The primary user is the Instructor.

## User Story
As an instructor, I want to create and manage my courses on the platform. When creating a course, I need to provide a title, description, and price. The course should initially be in a 'Draft' state. Once I'm ready, I can 'Publish' the course, making it available for students to enroll. If a course is outdated, I should be able to 'Archive' it, so it's no longer available for new enrollments but remains accessible to already enrolled students.

## Key Events
- CourseCreated
- CoursePublished
- CoursePriceUpdated
- CourseArchived
- StudentEnrolled

## DDL
```sql
-- Courses Table
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    instructor_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('DRAFT', 'PUBLISHED', 'ARCHIVED') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DRAFT',
    price_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    price_currency VARCHAR(3),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_instructor_id (instructor_id)
);
```

## Context Relations
### CourseToPayment
- **Type**: API Call
- **Direction**: calls
- **Target Context**: PaymentService
- **Reason**: When a student enrolls in a course, the CourseManagement context needs to initiate a payment process synchronously.
- **Interaction Pattern**: Makes a REST API call to the PaymentService to process the course fee."""
